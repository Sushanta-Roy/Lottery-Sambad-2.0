🚀 HOW TO TEST YOUR CONTACT FORM LOCALLY
==========================================

STEP 1: Start the PHP Server
-----------------------------
1. Go to: D:\codes\image web
2. Double-click: start-server.bat
3. A black window will open showing "PHP Development Server Starting..."
4. KEEP THIS WINDOW OPEN (don't close it!)

STEP 2: Open Your Website
--------------------------
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:8000/contact.html
3. Your contact page will load!

STEP 3: Test the Contact Form
------------------------------
1. Fill out the contact form with test data
2. Click "Send Message"
3. You should see: "Thank you for your message!"
4. An email will be sent to resultl460@gmail.com

STEP 4: Check Your Email
-------------------------
1. Open resultl460@gmail.com
2. Look for an email from your contact form
3. Check the spam folder if you don't see it

STEP 5: Stop the Server (When Done Testing)
-------------------------------------------
1. Go back to the black command window
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
3. Close the window

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
-------------------
• The server must be running to test the form
• Keep the black window open while testing
• Use http://localhost:8000 NOT file:// in your browser
• The PHP mail() function may not work on Windows without additional setup
• For production use, upload to your real web hosting server

🔴 IF EMAILS DON'T ARRIVE LOCALLY:
-----------------------------------
The PHP mail() function on Windows requires a mail server to be configured.
This is normal - it will work perfectly when you upload to your real web hosting!

FOR NOW, you can:
1. Just upload everything to your real server (RECOMMENDED)
2. Or use the mailto fallback that's already working

✅ ON YOUR REAL WEB SERVER:
---------------------------
Everything will work automatically - no setup needed!
Just upload all files and test on your live website.
