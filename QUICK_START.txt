📧 CONTACT FORM - QUICK START GUIDE
=====================================

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Contact form is configured
✅ Emails will be sent to: resultl460@gmail.com
✅ Fallback mailto link works locally

🔴 TESTING LOCALLY (Your Current Situation):
-------------------------------------------
You're seeing "Network error" because PHP requires a web server.

SOLUTION 1 - Use Mailto Fallback (NOW WORKING):
• Refresh the page
• Fill out the contact form
• Click Submit
• You'll see a button "Open Email Client"
• This will open your default email program with the message pre-filled
• Works immediately without any server setup!

SOLUTION 2 - Upload to Real Server (RECOMMENDED):
• Upload all files to your web hosting
• The PHP backend will work automatically
• Users will get instant success messages
• Emails will be sent directly to resultl460@gmail.com

🟢 WHEN YOU UPLOAD TO YOUR SERVER:
-----------------------------------
1. Upload these files:
   - contact.html
   - send-email.php
   - style.css
   - (all other website files)

2. Make sure your hosting has:
   - PHP enabled (most hosting has this)
   - Mail function enabled

3. Test the contact form on your live website

4. Check resultl460@gmail.com for test emails
   (Check spam folder if needed)

📝 WHAT HAPPENS:
----------------
Local Testing (Now):
• Form submits → Shows mailto button → Opens email client

Live Server (After Upload):
• Form submits → PHP sends email → Shows success message
• You receive formatted email at resultl460@gmail.com

✉️ EMAIL FORMAT YOU'LL RECEIVE:
--------------------------------
Subject: [Lottery Results Contact Form] General Inquiry - From: John Doe

Contact Details:
Name: John Doe
Email: johndoe@example.com
Subject: General Inquiry

Message:

💡 TIPS:
--------
• The mailto fallback works great for testing
• Once on a real server, the PHP backend takes over
• First emails might go to spam, mark as "Not Spam"
• You can reply directly from the email (Reply-To is set)

🆘 NEED HELP?
-------------
If emails don't arrive after uploading to your server:
1. Check spam folder
2. Contact your hosting provider about PHP mail()
3. Let me know and I can set up Gmail SMTP (more reliable)

That's it! The form is ready to use! 🎉
